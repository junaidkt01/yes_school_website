              In this nationwide educational network, all of them are working as
              a single team but in a hierarchy - serving in different posts like
              Directors, Regional / Zonal Managers, Heads of Departments, Zonal
              Co Ordinators, Principals, Teachers and so on. All these positions
              are only for the smooth functioning of the system. Inside the team
              everyone knows each other by their position, but externally we all

  joining the mission; No position is mentioned with the names.
  Let&apos;s have a look at them.
